Homework 5

This is my solution to HW5.

## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate ……..

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

import one dataset

``` r
data_1 = read_csv("lda_data/con_01.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   week_1 = col_double(),
    ##   week_2 = col_double(),
    ##   week_3 = col_double(),
    ##   week_4 = col_double(),
    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

Iterate over file names and tidy the result dataframe

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path)
  ) 

obs_df =
  path_df %>% 
  mutate(
    obs = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(obs) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_replace(path, "lda_data/", ""),
    path = str_replace(path, ".csv", "")
  ) %>% 
  tibble::rowid_to_column("index") %>% 
  separate(path, c("arms", "id")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "observations"
  )
```

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time.

``` r
obs_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observations, color = arms, group = index)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations of Each Object Over 8 Weeks",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observations",
    caption ="Data from the lda package"
  ) 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

<img src="p8105_hw5_yz3738_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

From the plot we can see the observation value tend to be higher in the
experiment groups than the control groups. While the level of the
observation values are more stable across the 8 weeks for objects in the
control group, an increasing trend is observed in the objects of the
experiment group.
